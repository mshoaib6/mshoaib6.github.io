Hello! I’m Muhammad Shoaib, a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/department/computer-science) at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), advised by Professor [Wajih Ul Hassan](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hur7wv/). My primary research focuses on attack forensics and threat detection.


# Research interests:
My current research interests include *Emerging Systems Security*, *Threat Detection*, *Program Analysis*, *SIEM Evasion*, and *Attack Forensics* in general. I am currently exploring how to evade SIEM systems more reliably.
